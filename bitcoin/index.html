			<h1>What is Bitcoin?</h1>
			<h2>The most popular cryptocurrency in the world</h2>
		</header>

		<div class="summary">
			<p>Introduced to the world in 2008, Bitcoin has since become the pioneering and most popular cryptocurrency 
			in the world. By using the blockchain and Bitcoin mining consensus mechanism, Bitcoin made peer-to-peer 
			digital payments viable. Bitcoin gives people, not institutions, the means to transfer money.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h3>The Origins of Bitcoin</h3>
			<p>On October 28th 2008, the world was forever changed. And like other world-changing events, this event was 
			not necessarily an action taken, but more an idea made known to the world. This idea was for an inflation-resistant, 
			double-spend proof, fully trustless and digital form of currency. The theory of this currency, laid out in the 
			“Bitcoin Whitepaper” opened people’s perceptions of currency to a reality where they could transfer money 
			transparently and anonymously.
			</p>
			<p>No one really knows who invented Bitcoin. The person, or group, went by Satoshi Nakamoto and all we really know 
			is that they are the developer of the world’s first and thus far most successful and popular form of decentralized, 
			peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency.

			<h3>Why is Bitcoin sometimes referred to as BTC?</h3>
			<p>If you’ve seen Bitcoin in the news, talked about on Twitter or in the media, you may have seen it referred to as BTC, 
			especially when people are talking about its price. BTC is the “ticker” or “symbol” used for listing Bitcoin on exchanges, 
			and every cryptocurrency has its own symbol. This mirrors traditional “stock tickers” that public companies use on stock 
			exchanges.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="popular">
			<h3>Why is Bitcoin worth so much now? Why is it so popular?</h3>
			<p>Bitcoin is the most successful and oft-used P2P digital currency. And it pioneered the rise of crypto and blockchain technology 
			because of the security and transparency it provides with its blockchain. With so much transaction volume and utility, Bitcoin 
			has become a very useful tool, and thus has gained immense value alongside its popularity.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="network">
			<h3>Who controls the Bitcoin network?</h3>
			<p>Everyone! The short answer is that since everyone, from those who mine Bitcoin to all those that buy, sell, and transfer it, completely 
			own the means to do so. Bitcoin is, by design, a decentralized, user-owned payment system.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="finance">
			<h3>Decentralizing finance</h3>
			<p>When Bitcoin was released to the public, it sent waves across the internet. But what exactly did it and does it mean for the world? We hear 
			a lot of terms get thrown around, like “the democratization of finance” or “banking the bankless”, so it’s pretty easy to get lost in the 
			jargon and buzzwords. Extrapolating from the immediate implications of Bitcoin a bit, it means that we, the users, own the means to transfer, 
			buy, sell and invest without the need for a 3rd party. Without the need for intermediaries, financial processes take less long and for a 
			fraction of the cost of their traditional counterparts.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="interest">
			<h3>Why is there so much interest in Bitcoin?</h3>
			<p>In the last 5 years, the value of one Bitcoin has grown over 4000%. Holy smokes, right?? And like traditional currency, it is because of its 
			utility that it has the value it has. But of course, unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (more often called P2P) payment 
			system that is owned by users rather than banks and other financial institutions. And once you have access to a Bitcoin wallet, you can send 
			and receive money anywhere and anytime.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="howwork">
			<h3>How exactly does Bitcoin work?</h3>
			<p>There are 21,000,000 Bitcoin in total, with over 18,000,000 currently in circulation. A decentralized network of computers are responsible for 
			securing the Bitcoin blockchain, verifying transactions and providing a consensus mechanism. This is what’s called “mining”, where computers process 
			and verify transactions in order to earn Bitcoin, linking together the individual blocks that record transactions on the blockchain. We go more into 
			what exactly “the blockchain” is in our “What is a blockchain” article. This sort of consensus mechanism is categorized as a “proof-of-work” system, 
			called so because of the amount of computational power required to verify transactions and secure the network.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="usage">
			<h3>What can you use Bitcoin for?</h3>
			<p>Because of the explosion in adoption by merchants around the world, Bitcoin can be used to buy anything from a new pair of Adidas shoes, to booking 
			flight tickets, to tipping your favorite creators on Twitch or Twitter. It is commonly said that Bitcoin has a great “store of value” like real estate 
			or gold, and as such, is becoming a popular long-term investment as well.
			</p>

		<div class="buy">
			<h3>Where you can buy Bitcoin</h3>
			<p>The easiest way to buy Bitcoin is through an exchange, like Poloniex. Our online exchange allows you to purchase Bitcoin with 40+ national currencies 
			right from your browser. Since its inception, the crypto market has matured, and thus getting Bitcoin has become a lot easier. Likewise, Poloniex offers
